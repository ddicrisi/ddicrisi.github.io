  <!-- Short Bio -->
  <p>
    Name / Program / Major
I’m in the MS in Data Science & Analytics program here at ODU, and my concentration is in AI and Machine Learning.”
I live in Virginia now, but I’m originally from Southern California, Orange County. 
    I retired after 21 years of service, and I currently work full-time as a Business Intelligence Analyst contractor supporting NAVIFOR.
I just finished a Master’s program at Virginia Tech focused on Business Data Analytics. 
    I enroled in ODU’s program because I wanted to go deeper into AI and machine learning, 
    I think the combination of business analytics and AI is going to be powerful in both government and industry.
I have strong interests in predictive maintenance, data pipelines, and dashboard automation, 
    especially with tools like Databricks, Qlik Sense, and Power BI. 
I would like to explore how to apply AI models to large, messy Navy maintenance datasets.
Fun fact—I’m a go-kart racer on the weekends with my Brother-In-Laws up and down the East Coast. 
    I do a lot of 3D printing and I like to tinker with Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects. 
    I have been working on building RC and autonomous vehicles that can be used around the house and yard.
